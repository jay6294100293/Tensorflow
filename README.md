## Introduction

Deep learning has revolutionized various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. This repository aims to provide hands-on experience with deep learning concepts through practical assignments. Each assignment covers a specific topic, guiding you through the implementation and understanding of deep learning models.

## Assignments Overview

1. **House Pricing Prediction:**
   - Predict the price of a house based on the number of bedrooms using a simple neural network.
   
2. **Hello World of Deep Learning with Neural Networks:**
   - Introduction to building neural networks using TensorFlow by predicting the relationship between two numbers.
   
3. **Computer Vision Example with Fashion MNIST:**
   - Dive into a computer vision problem using the Fashion MNIST dataset. Build a classification model to identify different types of clothing items.
   
4. **Using Callbacks to Control Training:**
   - Learn how to use callbacks in TensorFlow to control the training process. Create a custom callback to stop training based on a specified metric.

Each assignment includes code examples, explanations, and exploration exercises to deepen your understanding of the concepts covered. Feel free to explore each assignment and experiment with the provided code!
